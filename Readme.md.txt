Welcome to My Word Counter Website Project! 
This is a word counter website project made in Python and the Django framework for backend and (css,html) for frontend.The idea behind the project is to count the number of entered words by the user and print the count in another webpage.
This project is a good practice to deal with some operation when coding with python and django framework like moving dynamic data between front and backend, render html pages, and write views for each url and route between those urls.
